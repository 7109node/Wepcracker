For this script to function properly please set up a gnome-terminal profile named "hold"  set the profile to hold the terminal open upon completion. If this isn't done the arpreplay window and several others will close prior to you being able to view information to move on.

This script is just an automation of a mundane task many pentesters need to do, and is provided for educational purposes only.
